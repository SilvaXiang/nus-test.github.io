summary: 
abstract: "SQLancer, an open-source tool for testing database management systems (DBMS), is instrumental in uncovering bugs within real-world applications. However, maintaining SQLancer has become increasingly challenging due to tightly coupled components, which make it difficult to integrate new testing approaches or adapt the tool for different DBMS. This issue largely arises from the inconsistencies in SQL dialects, as each DBMS often implements unique features that deviate from standard SQL.
In this session, we’ll walk through strategies for rearchitecting SQLancer in a way that allows for ongoing enhancements without disrupting current functionality. We’ll also discuss techniques to facilitate interoperability between different SQL dialects, ensuring that SQLancer can effectively adapt to diverse DBMS."
